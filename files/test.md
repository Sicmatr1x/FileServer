Charles Stross

> 译文杂志发表：科幻世界2010年07期《抗体》[英] 查尔斯·斯特罗斯 [著] 中短篇小说  全文刊录

Although he made his first sale back in 1987, it’s only recently that British writer Charles Stross has begun to make a name for himself as a writer to watch in the new century ahead (in fact, as one of the key Writers to Watch in the Oughts), with a sudden burst in the last few years of quirky, inventive, high-bit-rate stories such as “A Colder War,” “Bear Trap,” “Dechlorinating the Moderator,” “Toast: A Con Report,” “Lobsters,” “Troubadour,” “Tourist,” “Halo,” “Router,” and “Nightfall,” in markets such as Interzone, Spectrum SF, Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine, Odyssey, Strange Plasma, and New Worlds. Stross is also a regular columnist for the monthly magazine Computer Shopper. He has “published” a novel online, Scratch Monkey, available to be read on his website (www.antipope.org/charlie/), and serialized another novel, The Atrocity Archive, in the magazine Spectrum SF. His most recent book is his first collection, Toast, and Other Burned Out Futures, and coming up is a major new novel, Singularity Sky. He’s been on the Hugo Final Ballot twice in the last two years: in 2002 with his story “Lobsters” and in 2003 with “Halo.” He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland.

In the fast-paced and innovative story that follows, he suggests that by the time you can begin to worry that it might not be a good idea to create a superintelligent A.I., it may already be too late to do anything about it.
